# Meme Me

### What is it about?

A simple iOS app to generate memes.
MemeMe is being done as part of the iOS Developer Nanodegree for Udacity. 

This app allows users to create a meme from an image either selected from their photo gallery or from the camera. 
Once they have an image selected, they can add a header and footer text to complete the meme.

Once they have perfected the meme, they can share their newly created meme with the world.

- Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
- Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
